If you wish to implement any of the algorithms, you should||||||
find the translation of our pseudocode into your favorite|||||||
programming language to be a fairly straightforward task. We||||
have designed the pseudocode to present each algorithm clearly||
and succinctly. Consequently, we do not address error-handling||
and other software-engineering issues that require specific|||||
assumptions about your programming environment. We attempt to|||
present each algorithm simply and directly without allowing the|
idiosyncrasies of a particular programming language to obscure||
its essence.||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
